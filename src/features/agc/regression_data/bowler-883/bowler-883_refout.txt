== Research Notes ==
=== Issues to be checked ===
Generated by WikiTree AGC. This section should be removed when all issues have been looked at.
* A fact of type 'Departure' had no date but shared a record ID with a 'Arrival' fact with the date '29 May 1848'. So the fact with no date had its date set to that.
* Changed '''Current Last Name''' from LNAB of 'Bowler' to the last name 'Plumbtree' of the last husband 'Elijah Plumbtree'.
