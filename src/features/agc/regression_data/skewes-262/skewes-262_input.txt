There were two forms of protest.In the first, the women (or their husbands) refused to fill in the form, often recording their protest on the household schedule. In the second, women evaded the census by staying away from their home for the whole night, and so did not lodge their protest on the household schedule. In both cases, any details relating to individual women in the households will be missing from the census. For the family historian, a refusal to fill in the form (accompanied by a protest statement) at least registers the presence of a woman, or women, in the household. But the women who evaded the count by leaving their home for the night are entirely untraceable via the census. The exact number of women who boycotted the census is not known, though some people have estimated that it may be as many as several thousand.DC Thomson Family History service provided to MyHeritage members by agreement with The National Archives, London.

Local registration districts had jurisdiction for recording civil events, but were required to send copies of their records each quarter to the General Register Office (GRO) in London. The GRO created indexes to these records which are organized by event, year, and quarter, and thereunder alphabetically by surname.Information included in the index changed over the years. The index always provides the name of deceased, registration district, and reference information (volume and page numbers). From 1866 to March 1969, the index also includes age. Beginning in June 1969 the index includes the deceased?s birth date rather than age. Information provided in the indexcan be used to order a copy of the person?s death certificate for a fee from the GRO through their Certificate Ordering Service. Depending on the year, full death certificates may provide: name of deceased, death date, death place, age, sex, occupation, cause of death, name of parent if the deceased is a child, informant?s name, residence, and relationship to the deceased, and date of registration. Note: Information recorded on a death certificate is only as accurate as the knowledge of the person reporting it. It is important to pay attention to who the informant was and their relationship to the deceased. The closer the relationship, the more reliable the information likely is. For years where images of the index are available, be sure to consult the image to verify the informationpresented to you. Sometimes errors happen during the transcription process. For example, a ?5? may have inadvertently been transcribed as a ?3?. Since there is a fee for ordering certificate copies from the GRO, it is especially important to make sure all reference numbers are correct before placing an order. Search tip: If an individual had multiple given names, sometimes only one or twoof these names was recorded in the index. In addition, some of the given names may have been recorded by initials only. If you?re having trouble locating someone in the index, try searching by any of the individual?s known given names, initials, or nicknames.

Censuses were conducted by the federal government andwill offer a variety of information, depending on year. Census records can answer questions like where your ancestors were living at the time the census was taken, who they were living with, what their occupations were, who their neighbors were, if they had any brothers and sisters, what their ages were at the time of the census and if they had any disabilities.Searching the censusThe golden ruleof family history is to check the original historical record, or 'primary source', wherever possible. We have provided clear images of the original census enumeration books for you to view once you've found the right family in the indexes. When using census returns you should first search the transcriptions to help locate your ancestor in the census, and then view the original images to validate your findings. It will also help you see the household in the context of surrounding households. This is particularly important as transcribing an entire census is a huge and difficult task, and whilst we have used the expertise of our transcribers and the experience of key representatives from the genealogy community to help us translate the records, it is inevitable that there will be some errors.Next stepsWith the information you gain from these census records, you will have the information you need to search for vital records in the locality where you found your ancestor. Also, the fact that census returns are taken every ten years also allows you to track the movements of our ancestors through time as they perhaps move house, get married, have children or even change occupations.
