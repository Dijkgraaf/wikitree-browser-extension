Local registration districts had jurisdiction for recording civil events, but were required to send copies of their records each quarter to the General Register Office (GRO) in London. The GRO created indexes to these records which are organized by event, year, and quarter,and thereunder alphabetically by surname. The index provides the name of the bride or groom, registration district, and reference information (volume and page numbers). Brides and grooms are both included in the index, but are listed separately under their own individual entries.Information provided in the index can be used to order a copy of the person’s marriage certificate for a fee from the GRO through their Certificate Ordering Service. Depending on the year, full marriage certificates may provide: marriage date and place, names of the bride and groom, their ages, marital status, professions, and residences. Information about the bride’s and groom’s fathers —names, occupations, and whether deceased—may also be listed. A marriage record typically indicates whether the marriage ceremony took place in a church and if so, the denomination.Note: For years where images of the index are available, be sure to consult the image to verify the information presented to you. Sometimes errors happen during the transcription process. For example,a "5" may have inadvertently been transcribed as a "3". Since there is a fee for ordering certificate copies from the GRO, it is especially important to make sure all reference numbers are correct before placing an order.Search tip: If an individual had multiple given names, sometimes only one or two of these names was recorded in the index. In addition, some of the given names may have been recorded by initials only.If you’re having trouble locating someone in the index, try searching by any of the individual’s known given names, initials, or nicknames.

One important difference for genealogists is the full date of birth is recorded in the 1939 Register for each person whereas the traditional censuses conducted in England and Wales only records each person’s age.The information in this collection was gathered under the authority of the National Registration Act of 1939 – an emergency measure at the start of the Second World War. 65,000 enumerators deliveredthe forms ahead of the official registration day. On Friday, 29 September 1939 (National Registration Day) householders were required to record the requested information on the supplied forms. On thefollowing Sunday and Monday local enumerators visited every household, checked and gathered the completed forms, and issued identity cards to each of the residents in the household.Of the 42 million individuals who are recorded in this collection, 8.2 million records remain closed due to privacy protection requirements, and about 700,000 additional records appear without full names. Records are closed for those individuals who were born less than 100 years ago unless matched to a registered death record. These closed records will be made public and added to this online collection on a yearly basis going forward.* The 1921 Census has not yet been released and is expected to be available online in 2022. The 1951 Census is closed until 2052.

The GRO created indexes to these records which are organized by event, year, and quarter, and thereunder alphabetically by surname.Information included in the index changed over the years. The index always provides the name of deceased, registration district, and reference information (volume and page numbers). From 1866 to March1969, the index also includes age. Beginning in June 1969 the index includes the deceased’s birth date rather than age. Information provided in the index can be used to order a copy of the person’s death certificate for a fee from the GRO through their Certificate Ordering Service. Depending on the year, full death certificates may provide: name of deceased, death date, death place, age, sex, occupation, cause of death, name of parent if the deceased is a child, informant’s name, residence, and relationship to the deceased, and date of registration. Note: Information recorded on a death certificate is only as accurate as the knowledge of the person reporting it. It is important to pay attention to who the informant was and their relationship to the deceased. The closer the relationship, the more reliable the information likely is. For years where images of the index are available, be sure to consult the image to verify the information presented to you. Sometimes errors happen during the transcription process. For example, a “5” may have inadvertently been transcribed as a “3”.

The GRO created indexes to these records which are organized by event, year, and quarter, and thereunder alphabetically by surname.Information included in the index changed over the years. From inception up to June 1911, the birth index lists: name of child, registration district, and reference information (volume and page numbers). Since September 1911 the index also includes the mother’s maiden surname.Information provided in the index can be used to order a copy of the person’s birth certificate for a fee from the GRO through their Certificate Ordering Service. Depending on the year, full birth certificates may provide: name of child, birth date, birthplace, sex, father’s name and occupation, mother’s maiden name, informant’s name, residence, and relationship to the child, and date of registration.Note: For years where images of the index are available, be sure to consult the image to verify the information presented to you.

Since there is a fee for ordering certificate copies from the GRO, it is especially important to make sure all reference numbers are correct before placing an order.Search tip: Compliance with registration laws have always been very good. It is estimated that initially about 90-95% of births were reported, but that by 1875 registration was 99%. Since nearly all births were reported, if you are having trouble finding someone in the index, try searching using various given names or initials. In later years, searching on the combination of child’s surname and mother’s maiden name (if known), may also help locate difficult-to-find individuals. If an individual can still not be found, especially in earlier years, try searching local parish records for the child’s baptismal record.
