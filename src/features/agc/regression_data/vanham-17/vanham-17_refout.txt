== Research Notes ==
=== Issues to be checked ===
Generated by WikiTree AGC. This section should be removed when all issues have been looked at.
* A burial fact had no date. Changed its date to be after the death date.
* A fact of type 'Residence' had no date but shared a ref with a 'Residence' fact with the date '1870'. So the fact with no date had its date set to that.
* Changed '''Current Last Name''' from LNAB of 'Vanham' to the last name 'Leurquin' of the last husband 'Alfred J Leurquin'.
