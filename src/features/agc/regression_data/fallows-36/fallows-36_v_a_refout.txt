=== Issues to be checked ===
Generated by WikiTree AGC. This section should be removed when all issues have been looked at.
* A burial fact had no date. Changed its date to be after the death date.
* There is no source with source id 'S64'. GEDCOMPare typically does this when there is a source which is a record for a different person (such as the spouse). The ref is still added but is missing the source repository data.
* There is no source with source id 'S65'. GEDCOMPare typically does this when there is a source which is a record for a different person (such as the spouse). The ref is still added but is missing the source repository data.
* There is no source with source id 'S66'. GEDCOMPare typically does this when there is a source which is a record for a different person (such as the spouse). The ref is still added but is missing the source repository data.
* There is no source with source id 'S735'. GEDCOMPare typically does this when there is a source which is a record for a different person (such as the spouse). The ref is still added but is missing the source repository data.
* A fact of type 'State File Number 104113' had no date but shared a ref with a 'Buried' fact with the date '18 December 1954'. So the fact with no date had its date set to that.
