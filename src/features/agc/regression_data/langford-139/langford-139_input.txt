== Research Notes ==
Sarah (Chafin) Almand's {{FindAGrave | 18832238|sameas=no}} mentioned that her daughter Alpharetta had the last name of Buice, but no sources have been found for her to be married to someone with that name. The 'contributor' of the Find a Grave pages states she made a mistake, that it was 'a typo' and has removed it, so the [[Buice-4|Unknown Buice]] profile was merged into the [[Langford-139 | James Langford]] profile. The only spouse for Alpharetta was [[Langford-139 | James Langford]]. <ref>Find a Grave, database and images (https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/18832238/sarah-jane-almand : accessed 15 October 2021), memorial page for Sarah Jane Chafin Almand (10 Jan 1832–22 Aug 1868), {{FindAGrave | 18832238|sameas=no}}, citing Almand Cemetery, Conyers, Rockdale County, Georgia, USA ; Maintained by Shirley Ann Carter Bennett Barham (contributor 46985785) .</ref>
