== Research Notes ==
Sarah (Chafin) Almand's {{FindAGrave | 18832238|sameas=no}} mentioned that her daughter Alpharetta had the last name of Buice, but no sources have been found for her to be married to someone with that name. The 'contributor' of the Find a Grave pages states she made a mistake, that it was 'a typo' and has removed it, so the [[Buice-4|Unknown Buice]] profile was merged into the [[Langford-139 | James Langford]] profile. The only spouse for Alpharetta was [[Langford-139 | James Langford]]. <ref>Find a Grave, database and images (https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/18832238/sarah-jane-almand : accessed 15 October 2021), memorial page for Sarah Jane Chafin Almand (10 Jan 1832–22 Aug 1868), {{FindAGrave | 18832238|sameas=no}}, citing Almand Cemetery, Conyers, Rockdale County, Georgia, USA ; Maintained by Shirley Ann Carter Bennett Barham (contributor 46985785) .</ref>

=== Issues to be checked ===
Generated by WikiTree AGC. This section should be removed when all issues have been looked at.
* A burial fact had no date. Changed its date to be after the death date.
* There is no source with source id 'S102'. GEDCOMPare typically does this when there is a source which is a record for a different person (such as the spouse). The ref is still added but is missing the source repository data.
