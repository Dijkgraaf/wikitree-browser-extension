* 1930 United States Federal Census Publication: MyHeritage Note: The 1930 Census determined the population of the United States to be 122,775,046. This is an increase of almost 16 percent over the 1920 Census, which reported a population of 106,021,537. This was the 15th decennial census conducted in the United States under authority granted by Article I, Section 2 of the United States Constitution. It was conducted in April 1930, except in Alaska, where it was conducted in late 1929. Until 2012 the 1930 Census is the latest available to the public, due to 72-year privacy laws. It is based on actual counts of persons living in residential structures.https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-10134-157930717/deana-thompson-in-1930-united-states-federal-census Note: Event: Record Role: 10134:157930717-:1d90451810450a0dfcf9e2b8a5fb9757 Deana Thompson; Gender: Female; Birth: Circa 1911 - Idaho, United States; Residence: 1930 - Downey, Bannock, Idaho, USAAge: 19Marital status: MarriedRace: WhiteLanguage: EnglishFather&#039;s birth place: Utah, United StatesMother&#039;s birth place: Idaho, United States; Husband: Adna L ThompsonCensus: <a id='household'></a>HouseholdRelation to head; Name; Age; Suggested alternativesHead; <a href="https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-10134-157930716/adna-l-thompson-in-1930-united-states-federal-census?s=517618641">Adna L Thompson</a>; 28; Wife; <a href="https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-10134-157930717/deana-thompson-in-1930-united-states-federal-census?s=517618641">Deana Thompson</a>; 19
* 1920 United States Federal Census Publication: MyHeritage Note: Federal census takers were asked to record information about every person who was in each household on the census day. A census taker might have visited a house on a later date, but the information he collected was supposed to be about the people who were in the house on the census day. The basic census enumeration unit was the county. Each county was divided into enumeration districts, one for each enumerator. The completed forms were sent to the Commerce Department's Census Office in Washington, D.C.Federal censuses are usually reliable, depending on the knowledge of the informant and the care of the census enumerator. Information may have been given to a census taker by any member of the family or by a neighbor. Some information may have been incorrect or deliberately falsified.https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-10133-113655489/deana-stoddard-in-1920-united-states-federal-census Note: Event: Record Role: 10133:113655489-:509ee506e4a7bcf22422b71f94d877a3 Deana Stoddard; Gender: Female; Birth: Circa 1912 - Idaho, United States; Residence: 1920 - Twin Falls, Idaho, USAAge: 8Marital status: SingleRace: WhiteEthnicity: AmericanFather: Joseph D StoddardFather&#039;s birth place: Utah, United StatesMother: Maud E StoddardMother&#039;s birth place: Idaho, United States; Siblings: Erma L Stoddard, Joseph D Stoddard, Theo W StoddardCensus: <a id='household'></a>HouseholdRelation to head; Name; Age; Suggested alternativesHead; <a href="https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-10133-113655486/joseph-d-stoddard-in-1920-united-states-federal-census?s=517618641">Joseph D Stoddard</a>; 35; Wife; <a href="https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-10133-113655487/maud-e-stoddard-in-1920-united-states-federal-census?s=517618641">Maud E Stoddard</a>; 31; Daughter; <a href="https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-10133-113655488/erma-l-stoddard-in-1920-united-states-federal-census?s=517618641">Erma L Stoddard</a>; 11; Daughter; <a href="https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-10133-113655489/deana-stoddard-in-1920-united-states-federal-census?s=517618641">Deana Stoddard</a>; 8; Son; <a href="https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-10133-113655490/joseph-d-stoddard-in-1920-united-states-federal-census?s=517618641">Joseph D Stoddard</a>; 5; Son; <a href="https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-10133-113655491/theo-w-stoddard-in-1920-united-states-federal-census?s=517618641">Theo W Stoddard</a>; 2 years, 5 months
