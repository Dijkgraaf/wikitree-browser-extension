=== Issues to be checked ===
Generated by WikiTree AGC. This section should be removed when all issues have been looked at.
* A fact of type 'Residence' had no date but shared a ref with a 'Died' fact with the date '1824'. So the fact with no date had its date set to that.
* A fact of type 'Residence' had no date but shared a DB ID with a 'Marriage' fact with the date '20 April 1783'. So the fact with no date had its date set to that.
* Changed birth date from '1765' to 'before' the baptism date of '11 May 1765'.
* The profile '''Current Last Name''' of 'Katenback' does not match the last name of the last husband 'August Katenbeck'.
