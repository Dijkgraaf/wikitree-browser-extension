== Research Notes ==
=== Sources with no fact or date ===

There are additional sources with no facts or date. Often these are sources for the baptism or marriage of children that mention the parents or father. This section can just be removed if you will be adding those children and using these sources there.<ref>'''Unclassified''': Guertin, Iris, Rose, comp Connecticut Soldiers, French and Indian War, 1755-62 Publication: Name: Name: Online publication - Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2000.

* There is no source with source id 'S9'. GEDCOMPare typically does this when there is a source which is a record for a different person (such as the spouse). The ref is still added but is missing the source repository data.
