== Biography ==

===Ancestry in England===

The Browning family were residents in the Gloucester (England) region before 1335 and had been major businessmen, land owners, sheriffs, members of parliament and hosts to various noblemen over the years.  The name may be spelled as Bruning, Brunyn, Brounyng as well as Browning.

 The Demarron name is of French extraction and may be connected to the invasion of William the Conqueror of Normandy in 1066.  

===Birth===

Captain John Browning was born in England about 1589 

===Arrival===

He sailed from Gravesend, England in the ship "Abigail" in 1621. His ship landed on "College Lands", later known as Jamestown, York County, Virginia.

===Marriage and Children===

 His known children (with wife Elizabeth Dameron) were George, William, and Joseph Browning. 
#George was born in England in 1614, 
#William was born in England in 1615, and 
#Joseph was born in England in 1617. 

George and William came with their father Captain John on the "Abigail" to America. Joseph came after them aboard the ship "Thomas", leaving London on August 21, 1635. Joseph settled in Jamestown.

===Elizabeth City===

 Captain John finally settled in Elizabeth City. He was a prominent citizen and served as Burgess of Elizabeth City in 1629, of Morris Bay in 1632, and again of Elizabeth City in 1635. In 1638 he purchased 3,000 pounds of tobacco and all land lying in Mounds Bay and belonging to Thomas Grindon.

==Research Notes==

Edward F. Browning's "Genealogy of the Browning Family 1908" (reprinted by the Higginson Book Co., Salem, Mass) has one defect in that it confuses Virginia descendants of [[Browning-501|Captain John Browning]] with Maryland descendants of [[Browning-1681|Edward Browning]], especially with respect to the vicinity of Culpeper, Virginia.  At this point these are separate families with no known connection.[[Day-1904|Day-1904]] 20:58, 8 October 2018 (UTC)
