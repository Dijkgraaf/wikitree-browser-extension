== Research Notes ==
=== Issues to be checked ===
Generated by WikiTree AGC. This section should be removed when all issues have been looked at.
* A fact of type 'Residence' had no date but shared a DB ID with a 'Marriage' fact with the date '8 August 1888'. So the fact with no date had its date set to that.
* Changed '''Current Last Name''' from LNAB of 'Pavey' to the last name 'Harbour' of the last husband 'Robert Mott Harbour'.
